# Instructions

Please submit a critical summary, contribution, or evaluation of 200-300 words for each paper. In your summary, provide a concise overview of the key points discussed in each paper. Explain the main findings, methodologies used, and any significant insights or recommendations provided by the authors.

For those students who may not be familiar with writing critical summaries, here are some guidelines to help you:

- Start by reading each paper carefully. Identify the main objectives, research questions, or problems addressed by the authors.
- Summarize the key ideas and arguments presented in each paper. Focus on the main findings or outcomes of the research.
- Provide a brief explanation of how each paper relates to your own project. Highlight any similarities or differences between the authors' work and your own goals or objectives.
- Consider the strengths and weaknesses of each paper. Are there any limitations in the methodology or scope of the research? Are there areas that could have been explored further?
- Reflect on the significance of each paper to the broader field of study. Does it contribute new insights or offer valuable recommendations? Discuss the potential impact or implications of the findings.
- Use clear and concise language in your summaries. Avoid excessive technical jargon and ensure that your writing is accessible to readers who may not have a deep background in the subject matter.

# Reading List Critical Summary (Group 1)

## [PBKDF2 NIST Publication](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf)

Main objectives/Research questions/Problems addressed:
- Low entropy and (sometimes) poor randomness of passwords, they are not suitable to be directly used as cryptographic keys
- Article specifies a family of password-based key derivation functions (PBKDFs) to derive better cryptographic keys from passwords

Key Ideas:
- To obtain a high-entropy master key for encryption purposes, combine a user password with a salt through a KDF
- The salt must be at least 128 bits
- Instead of HMAC-ing password+salt once, perform many iterations of HMAC using the result of the previous iteration

Strengths:
- From NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), very reputable source
- Easily scales with newer, more powerful hardware
- Easily adjustable to work on platforms of varying capability

Weaknesses:
- Overall security of the specified algorithm depends on either sufficiently random inputs, or sufficiently high iteration count. Higher iteration count => slower key generation, which may not be suitable for all applications

## [Keccack Implementation Overview](https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-implementation-3.2.pdf)

Main objectives/Research questions/Problems addressed:
- Provide an overview of the `Keccak` family of algorithms, which underly cryptographic algorithms such as SHA-3.

Key Ideas:
- The key ideas of the paper are primarily the optimization methods depending on software and hardware conditionss

Strengths:
- Built on the sponge design, allowing any arbitrary-length input to be digested to a fixed- and chooseable output length
- Fast to compute, on par with SHA-256
- Constant memory usage, with no feed-forward loop
- A variety of implementation techniques are discussed, allowing optimization on many common instruction sets

Weaknesses:
